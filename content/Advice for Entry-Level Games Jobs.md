# Intro
Over the last year or so I’ve put a lot of thought into entry-level and junior jobs in games. Primarily because the topic is completely unavoidable in any social space related to game dev. But also because I've had several chats with folks who are trying to either get into games or are trying to move into more steady and interesting work in games.

This post is my attempt to capture all of the, admittedly, disorganized advice I’ve given in a referenceable and shareable form.

## Who is this for?

Technically-aligned persons trying to enter the game industry or trying to advance beyond your first job or two in the industry. 

There’s a critical moment of “surface tension” in the 3-5 year range where you suddenly feel like you have, real, desirable, and specific skills. This advice is for people who don’t think they’ve quite broken through that yet but want to.

This will be less useful if you already know exactly what you want to do and are doing it. Still, there's some advice in here (especially in the "Hiring Manager" section) that I use in job searches to this day so you might still find value if you're not the target audience.

Finally, this post is about identifying shortcomings and representing yourself well. It is not about getting good at one specific skill. Maybe I'll eventually type that up too but here I've consciously selected for "generally applicable".

## Caveats

- **I am one person.** This advice is personal. This is what worked for me. It may work for you. It may not. Take what I’ve said here and add it to as much other information as you can in order to make it useful.
- **I have not had to search for junior roles in many years.** I think a lot of this is still very relevant, very helpful advice. You may disagree. You may be right. I want to hear about your experiences where they differ from mine.
- **This market is hard.** There are times in the recent past where game jobs were significantly easier to acquire. Searching now undoubtedly means more struggle and more patience. No way around that. Better to buckle-in with knowledge of the bumpiness of the ride.

## Structure

This is a long post so I've split it up a bit into three sections.

**[Think Like a Hiring Manager](#think-like-a-hiring-manager) -** Advice on identifying why you’re not getting (or even getting callbacks for) the roles you want.

**[Cover the Skills Gap](#cover-the-skills-gap) -** Advice on how to make yourself a more appealing candidate for those roles.

**[FAQ](#faq) -** What it says on the tin. Frequent questions I’ve gotten in informational interviews. Only read 'em if you want.

# Think Like a Hiring Manager
## Hiring is Reducing Risk

Pull up the description for a position you recently applied for. I want you to stand up and sit on the other side of the metaphorical table for a moment. You are now the hiring manager. Ask yourself a few questions:

- Who am I? (Aka what is my position? How did I get here? What are my responsibilities?)
- Why did I post this position? (Aka what problem did I see that no one on my team could fix already?)

And then the big one:

- Would I hire this person sitting across from me to solve that problem?

“**Answer these three questions every time you apply**”. Its probably the most important advice in this post.

But stretching this muscle is **hard** the first few times you do it. So here’s some guidance.

## **Every Job Post is a Cry For Help**

The hiring manager will have a problem they’re trying to solve. There's a reason they were able to get their hands on the money they're using to hire. Either they see a problem in the future or they're having a problem right now. **Identify that problem.**

This is really hard to do if you’ve never been in the hiring position yourself. But it is absolutely worth doing. So here’s a few pointers:

1. Find the likely hiring manager on LinkedIn or the company’s page. LinkedIn generally makes this very easy. Just search the company and department and scroll until you find relevant people. Posting is “Generalist Gameplay Engineer”? Your hiring manager is probably a “Senior/Lead Gameplay Engineer” on the same project at the same company. You will get better at identifying this person with practice. It’s fine to guess wrong here. The important part is to try.
2. Read the hell out of the companies publicly posted details. Look at their company page, any gaming news sites that mention them, their youtube channel, etc. Ask yourself:
    - Is this their first game? 
    - What have they previously launched? 
    - How far along is this game? 
    - Same genre as their previous games? 
    - Same engine? 

    I have had super senior candidates that come in without any idea of which of our games they would be working on. This is insanity.
3. Think about what challenges are likely to arise with where they currently are in the process.
    - Are they starting fresh? 
    - Could it be they’re just running out of hands needed to ramp up? 
    - Are they a year in and starting to scale? 
    - Just need someone to create content?
    
    Reference your observations about the company and the job description. Make some educated guesses. **Write them down.**
4. Ask the interviewers to validate your guesses when you interview.  Ask:
    -  “What made you think about posting this role?” 
    - “What problems would this role primarily be concerned with solving?” 
    
    Not only are these A+ smart person responses to the inevitable “Any questions for me?” section of the interview but they **allow you to validate if your guess was right or wrong**.

## Would I Hire Me?

You should now have a strong guess of what the posting itself is about. Keep your hiring manager hat on. Pull up your resume. Remember, this is the first time "you" have seen it. Would you hire this person? Would you even want to bring them in? If the answer is:

- **"Yes, absolutely"**
    
    I really hope you’ve got a callback coming soon! If you don’t get called for a job that you think is a “yes absolutely”, then one of two things happened:

    - You were just a little late and its closed, or an internal person filled it, or the budget got cut, or the studio got cut(!) or another unlucky thing occurred. Sadly, this is not infrequent. Its why jobs are always to some degree a numbers game! 

    or 

    - You’re wrong. Your skills and resume are not as strong as you think. If a solid portion of the apps you send out seem like perfect fits and you get no bites then it is increasingly likely that you have a blind spot. Find it. Ask other people to help you find it. Ask me to help you find it!

- **"Maybe"**
    
    That’s a no. Remember, hiring is about reducing risk and entry-level is a crowd. You need to be a **strong** “yes absolutely”.

- **“No”**
    
    You should now have enough information to at least make an educated guess as to why. You either need to find a better fitting position for your skills or address the missing skillset directly (see “Skill Gap”).

## Cover Letters
Your end goal is to use this knowledge to make an extremely strong case for yourself. You can do this during the interview, and you absolutely should, but you should also include a short (very short) cover letter that makes the case that you will solve the problems they're having.

The structure of these should be:

- Intro
    
    One to three sentences saying "hello" and "I'm very interested". Keep it short. This part doesnt change between applications (except swapping out a job or company name).
- "Problems I Can Solve"

    The meat of the cover letter. 3 - 4 bullets points 2 sentences each **that change for every job**. Use this format: "You are looking for someone to do X. I have done Y" where:
    - X is a specific problem you identified in the above sections.
    - Y is a time you encountered that problem and helped solve it. This should be a bullet on your resume too, you're calling specific attention to it.

    An example: "You are looking for someone to help implement multiplayer networking in your Unity game. While working at Game Corp I wrote the netcode for their first online multiplayer Unity title 'Mechdrop 3' including frame-by-frame rollback."

- Outro
    
    One or two sentences saying "Thanks for your interest". In fact, you can literally just say that and then add your name at the bottom.

This will make for a **strong** cover letter. You are essentially doing the work of reading your resume for the recruiter or manager. Something in this format will get read more often than not and is absolutely worth doing for every position you apply for. 

You might say, "Preston, this is a ton of work". Yes it is. But you’re unemployed. And also…


## You’re Applying to too Many Jobs

Probably. 

If you really try to empathize with the hiring manager and ask yourself, 'Why would I hire me?' and your answer is 'I really wouldn’t,' then please, please (please) don’t apply for that position! Spend your time on something with a chance for success.

I can not state to you the number of times someone has told me they don’t know why they didn’t get a callback for a position and then when they showed me the position it did not **remotely** resemble the skills on their resume. 

A note on "Apply even if you don't meet 100% of the requirements". This is true. If you're about 70% of the way there, go for it. Job descriptions are often wishful thinking. They describe the ideal candidate not the acceptable canidate. So give yourself some leeway. But please, be honest. Make sure you're at least clearing that 70% mark.

Spend more time on fewer, better fitting positions. Tweak your resume for every position, send a customized cover letter every time. Quality wins here.

**How many is too many?** Beyond the first week or two of searching (when all the jobs are new jobs), I find it pretty hard to believe that there will be more than a role a or two a day that actually fits well.

# Cover the Skills Gap

## Do I Have To Have a Job to Get a Job

We’ll start with the elephant in the room: “I found the reason I’m not getting callbacks: I don’t have enough years of experience.” This is usually viewed as a catch-22. How can you get job experience if you don’t have enough experience to get a job? 

Requiring a certain amount of experience is a super easy way to reduce risk in hiring. If you’ve been doing this for 2-3 years, have had some success, and have not been fired for cause…awesome. 

**Years of experience is how companies make sure someone else paid for you to make mistakes.** 

So what does this mean for you the candidate? It means the single most valuable thing you can do as a junior is to make yourself look like a lot less of a risk. The absolute best way to not look like a risk to **have previously done the same or a similar job.** The next best way is to **look like you could** do the job without too much risk.

## Portfolio Projects

First, a note on the **games** in your portfolio: No one cares about the games in your portfolio. They do absolutely nothing to de-risk you as a candidate. Portfolio games prove that you can set up Unity character controllers. You know who else can do that? Everyone. Managers are hiring you to work on a small part of a large project run by a large team. Having a bunch of portfolio games doesn’t prove that you can handle any of that. 

So what does work? The best junior “portfolio pieces” I’ve seen meet these criteria:

1. **Are not a game.** 

    No one will hire you to build a game from scratch so its not the most impressive thing to show off. Show me a single, helpful, system, plugin, or API instead.
2. **Are built by a team with varied skillsets.** 

    Anything more than 2 people looks better. At an absolute minimum I’ll know you know how to use version control! Ideal projects aren’t 4 students working on something. Its juniors and seniors working to make a thing together. Open source contributions are a great way to work with larger teams of more experienced people. Contract work can also be a useful way to get in some projects with a team.
3. **Are meant to assist others.** 

    These are projects that are meant to solve a problem that other people are encountering.

Some examples that I’ve seen that were very impressive:

- A grid-based RPG plugin for Unity. Easily create characters that move around on a grid including a “grid backend” for quickly checking occupied and tagged squares.
- Contributions to the open-source Subnautica C# multiplayer mod.
- A system, written in python, that stored Skyrim saves to GitHub and allowed players to pull and run specific tagged saves.

The easiest way to find and pick good projects is to think about things that are difficult or annoying for you in your work. Then see if someone is already attempting to solve it, help! If no one is working on it, start, and get others to help you. 

If you have made or contributed to a plugin or repo **that other people are downloading and using** you are in the .01% (I made that up, but I’m right) of candidates. And more importantly you’ll be as close to looking risk-free as possible.

## **Rare and Valuable Skills**

So far I’ve talked about how to make yourself look compelling in your chosen field but there’s another component to being hireable…your chosen field. 

Don’t let me, or anyone, talk you out of your dreams but please, please be very certain you know:

1. **What your chosen role looks like at a high level.** 

    There are, for example, vanishingly few “game composers”. That is basically just not what a job in sound looks like. Its a lot of FMOD. Like a lot. Is that actually what you want to be doing? Make sure you know for sure.
2. **What the prospects for your position looks like.** 

    The number of aspiring generalist gameplay engineers is vastly, vastly higher than the number of generalist gameplay engineer roles. There are other engineering disciplines where this is not true. You should know what your outlook is and have a plan for it. If you tell me you are a “junior narrative designer with 3 months of savings left and no other job” I will smile sweetly, but sadly, at you. Please understand your position.
3. **What the path to your position looks like.**

    My first 3 tech jobs were at a program that assisted people with cerebral palsy, a charter school, and a credit card startup. Despite this, I had zero problems transitioning to games when moving to Seattle. 

    For some positions lateral moves work really well (sometimes better than trying to fight for entry-level positions!). For others you **must** move through a series of pre-prescribed positions. Know what this path looks like for your chosen role. 

The easiest way to acquire this knowledge is to talk to people in that field and ask good, pointed questions like:

- What did you work on this week? Today?
- What were your projects in the last few games you worked on?
- What did your path to this role look like?

You’d be shocked by the number of people who want to be an X and can’t even guess what a day in the life of a senior X looks like. People are generally extremely willing to talk about themselves if you reach out and ask them (ask me how I know...)

The goal of this research is twofold:

1. **You can select a role at the intersection of your interests and hireability.** 
    
    As you acquire this knowledge, look for things that interest you **and** are in high demand. Most people with experience can tell you how easy it was to get into their domain.

    Speaking as a middle-of-the-road backend engineer who has gotten incredible opportunities, having a highly desired skillset simply makes life easier. And more importantly, it lets you choose better projects to work on!

2. **You will sound like a senior in interviews**. 

    Specificity reads like seniority. If you can confidently speak to what you want to offer (and be offered) you will sound like a boss. Literally. 

    I have seen so many interviewees fumble on the question “What do you most want to work on?” by answering “Oh I just want to help out ya know?”. That is a terrible answer. Know what they need and how your skills meet those needs.

    Much better is "While I'm willing to help out with anything the project needs, I'm mostly focused on contributing to X. It seems like your project needs someone to help fill the gaps there and I think my experiences with X are a really good fit." Throw in some examples of you performing well at X and you have **slaughtered** that question.

# Outro

Being junior at anything is, counterintuitively, the hardest part. The level of uncertainty and lack of perspective can be crushing. I remember it, and I remember hating it. If this has bestowed even one point of clarity to you I'll consider my work here worth it.

If this has been helpful (or you've found a typo) I'd love to hear from you! I'd also really love to hear about anything that could use more fleshing out. This is broad advice and I'd like to dig down a bit. Knowing what people are looking for would be a huge help!

# FAQ

**What about my resume? How’s it look?**

This is already too long so that’ll need to be another post. Here’s my tiny form advice:
- One page.
- Bullets under your positions should represent what you, uniquely, did well. “Improved widget throughput by 85% by implementing efficient widget queueing” not “Worked on widget queueing system”.
- No skills sections. Work your skills and technologies into your bullet points. They’ll still be there for the automated system. E.g. “Wrote custom pathfinding algo in C++ that improved path recalculation time by 40% in Unreal Engine 5”.
- Personal projects are not nearly as important as professional. Deprioritize them in favor of team-based projects.

**You’re suggesting I apply to jobs through the website? The automated system? I thought everything was about networking.**

This is definitely going to be my most controversial take: Use your network to find work if you can. But applying through the company website is not a disadvantage. I have found every single job I’ve had that way. I think every person I’ve ever hired came in through a “cold apply”. It’s 100% fine. Networking is vital for having solid references though, so do keep up with your peers.

**I’ve gotten a few contract roles now, but they always end, and I’m back to searching? How do I “break in” to the big leagues/full-time work/more interesting work?**

This is, usually, what I call “Unity Hell”. Being stuck doing project setup for (almost always) Unity projects on contract for crap pay. The entire “Skills Gap” portion of this post addresses this trap pretty directly. But, if you’re getting something out of those roles, and can articulate what you did and learned, you’re probably fine. There’s nothing wrong with contract work if it’s building a compelling story of your improvement.

**I may not have the best skills but I can offer to work for less! Does that work?**

This is the definition of “Race to the Bottom”. **Please don’t do this.** It’s a perfect way to get stuck in the aforementioned “Unity Hell” forever. Outside of scammy contract work it’s also just not a real thing. Managers already have a salary range. They make a decision on who they want and then, and only then, figure out if they can pay what they need.

**Since I’m going to be locating the hiring manager anyways, should I email/message them directly to express my interest?**

I **strongly** advise against it. Personally, I would hold this against a candidate. The best time to connect with someone on LinkedIn, or send them an email, is right after you’ve spoken to them in the interview, and include a thank you. If all you’ve done is apply for a job they’re tangentially connected to. Nah. Please don’t.

**This is bullshit, I’m getting rejected because AI is bad and the automated system isn’t seeing enough keywords on my resume.**

Possibly. I’ve never had to be a junior applying for work in the new modern hellscape so you may be right. But I think you’re missing something. Companies **want** **to hire the right person.** It is exceedingly costly to make a mistake. And while it is extremely likely that you have been falsely rejected a fair few times, its far, far more likely in any given posting that you were not the right person for the job.

**Best game of the last 10 years?**

No one actually asked me this but I need you to know that its **Outer Wilds** and its not even close
